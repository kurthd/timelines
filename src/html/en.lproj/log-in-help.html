<p>
Tapping the "Go" button on the keyboard may register as denying Twitbit access
to your Twitter account, so be careful to instead dismiss the keyboard and
explicitly select "Allow".  If you accidentally deny access, simply dismiss the
log in view by tapping "Cancel" and start over.
</p>

<p>
Once you have successfully granted Twitbit access to your account, you will be
supplied with a personal identification number.  Enter that number in the "PIN"
field and tap "Done".
</p>

<h3>Why do I need a PIN?</h3>
<p>
Twitbit uses a protocol called "OAuth" for accessing your Twitter account.
Because OAuth allows Twitbit to avoid collecting your username and password, it
requires a PIN for access.
</p>

<h3>What is OAuth?</h3>
<p>
OAuth is an open, standard and secure authorization protocol.  One primary
advantage of OAuth over alternatives is that you do not need to provide Twitbit
with your username and password.  If you later decide to revoke Twitbit's
access, you may do so from Twitter -- without changing your password, and
without revoking access to other applications. Learn more about it at
<a href="http://oauth.net/">http://oauth.net/</a>.
